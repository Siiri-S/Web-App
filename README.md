## Hello and welcome to my personal Web App project repo

This is my personal project with the goal to produce a web appplication to promote me and my skills. I've taken different design and architecture decisions to either enhance my existing skills or to learn new skills.

You can find the latest version of the app [**here**](https://main.d3mljzvkcgimev.amplifyapp.com/)

The project is still in progress and following list gives a rough plan for the project:

- [x] Initialise the project and connect to AWS amplify
- [ ] Create initial frontend using React **(in progress)**
- [ ] Create server functionality with AWS Lambda
- [ ] Create GraphQL API using DynamoDB
- [ ] Connect frontend to the AWS Lambda and API
- [ ] Add more functionalities (authentication etc.)
- [ ] Get and set own domain
